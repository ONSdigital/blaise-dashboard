# blaise-dashboard

Web-based dashboard to view the status of various aspects of the data within a Blaise environment.

This project is a React.js application which when built is rendered by a Node.js express server.

The application is being deployed to Google App Engine.

### Components

#### Completed case information

Shows count, percentage, and progress bar of the cases completed for all installed questionnaires. It's currently filtered to OPN only until questionnaire logic is updated for all surveys.

A collapsible element shows the definition of completed cases, as this could be misconstrued depending on the context.

The component has a configurable refresh, currently set to 10 seconds.
